# ThreatPinchLookup

## Introduction

ThreatPinch Lookup creates informational tooltips when hovering oven an item of interest on any website. It helps speed up security investigations by automatically providing relevant information upon hovering over any IPv4 address, MD5 hash, SHA2 hash, and CVE title. Itâ€™s designed to be completely customizable and work with any rest API.

_A sample of the type of data that can be displayed when hovering over an IPv4 address._

## Current IOC Support

## Where is my data stored?

There is no backend server or database for ThreatPinch Lookup. All data related to API integrations or lookup configurations resides in your Chrome session storage, this allows your configurations to work in any Chrome browser your account is linked to.  Look up history information is stored in your browsers local storage due to the Chrome session storage limits, and lookup history can be viewed or wiped in the developers options for now. This means your lookup history will not follow you from browser to browser.

Optionally, in the developers options you can configure a CouchDB server to sync your API responses with. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/cloudtracer/ThreatPinchLookup/wiki) for more details.
