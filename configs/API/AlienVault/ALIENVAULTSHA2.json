Our vision is for companies and government agencies to gather and share relevant, timely, and accurate information about new or ongoing cyberattacks and threats as quickly as possible to avoid major breaches (or minimize the damage from an attack). AlienVaultâ€™s Open Threat Exchange (OTX) delivers the first truly open threat intelligence community that makes this vision a reality.",
